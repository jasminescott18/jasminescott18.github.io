                interest in social media, education, and web development.

                On my free time I enjoy free-time watching anime, drawing, and working out. My favorite anime is Dragon
                Ball Z. There are so many reasons why
                It is my favorite, but I was save explaining that for later. My favorite character of all time is
                Vegeta. He is just the perfect representation of a male.
                I also like how different he is from other archetypes in shows. He is quite different for a lot of other
                characters. My second favorite characteris
                is Bakugou Katsuki.
