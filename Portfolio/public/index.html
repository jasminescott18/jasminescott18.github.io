          A third year Computer Science undergraduate student at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology with an
          interest in social media, education, and web development.
          I am ready to assist a company's needs through software development, UX design, web development, and
          database administration.

        <p>
          On my free time I enjoy free-time watching anime, drawing, and working out. These three things have been
          my favorite activites to do since I was 15. I discovered both anime and drawing at around the same time,
          the former leading to the latter. And I continued to do both activies since. They are my
          "stress-relievers"
          or coping mechanisms.
        </p>
        <p>I have always considered myself a gym rat since I first started doing sports at the age of
          10, but I just recently started going to the gym this past summer. I have not set any real goals for
          myself other
          than eventually gaining the courage to use the squat rack.
