                A third year Computer Science undergraduate student at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology with an
                interest in social media, education, and web development.
                I am ready to assist a company's needs through software development, UX design, web development, and
                database administration.

            <p>
                On my free time I enjoy free-time watching anime, drawing, and working out. These three things have been
                my favorite activites to do since I was 15. I discovered both anime and drawing at around the same time,
                the former leading to the latter. And I continued to do both activies since. They are my
                "stress-relievers"
                or coping mechanisms.
            </p>
            <p>I have always considered myself a gym rat since I first started doing sports at the age of
                10, but I just recently started going to the gym this past summer. I have not set any real goals for
                myself other
                than eventually gaining the courage to use the squat rack.
